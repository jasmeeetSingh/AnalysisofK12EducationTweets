This repository provides an in-depth analysis of over 100 million education-related tweets from across the United States. 
It aims to answer several key questions:
1. Identifying the most influential accounts that tweet about education
2. Categorizing these accounts by domain (government entities, universities, schools, non-profit organizations, news outlets, social media influencers, or others), 
3. Understanding the relationships between emerging education issues and the locations and progression of these users.

Furthermore, I examined the geographic spread of these tweets, tracked the timeline of these tweets, and seeked to identify potential reasons for any trends observed. 
Additionally, I conducted text similarity analysis of the tweets, comparing them across groups and users.
